add profiling, debug outputs
reduce unneccessary forward declares
cleanup, refactor and comment code
correct versioning
more verbose with DVERBOSE
add static, inline to methods
compile dynamic libs - fPIC
work on conda recipe
test on windows, add appveyor
multiple passes normalization
adaptive b,c rescaling
fix D, E to be inverse
re-add approximate convergence check
move setup time output higher
add WARM_START iteration bump so approximate convergence works better in those cases

NOTE: higher d->SCALE makes pri resid go down faster, lower makes dual resid go down faster
