add profiling, debug outputs
fix weird timer overflow bug - setup phase
correct versioning
more verbose with DVERBOSE
add static to methods
compile dynamic libs - fPIC
work on conda recipe
test on windows
multiple passes normalization
adaptive b,c rescaling
fix D, E to be inverse
re-add approximate convergence check
NOTE: higher d->SCALE makes pri resid go down faster, lower makes dual resid go down faster
